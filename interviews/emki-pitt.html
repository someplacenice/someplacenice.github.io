                  Tell us a little bit about how you came to make art, what's your background?
              </p>

                  <strong>EP</strong>
Art was something that was going to play a part in my life. It was something I would escape into as boredom set in as a kid. As I got older I began seriously considering the prospect of being a full time artist. 
I took the route of many aspiring artists and I studied art at uni, then once I finished I rented a studio and have worked independently since. <br>
Art is a such a conscious part of who I am it’s personally difficult to define my background, because making art is pretty much all I do; it is the backdrop that everything experienced falls onto.

**Tell us more about the content of your work. I see a lot of ‘monsters’, but some figures also appear to be god like. What can you tell us about the creatures in your work?**
World mythology and folklore have been something that has always interested me. How they change with their society, but the ideologies are always similar. My work is attempting to create new myths (at least the creatures within those myths) that are tangible with the world that we experience. 

I like to imagine a filter. One that has been placed over our eyes, and we see the world as we do. But behind that filter are these creations and creators that are born from our actions and emotions. These unseen beings are something I try to bring into this reality as vessels of symbols and conduits of my thoughts, my feelings towards my lived experience and the world I experience it in. 

**Interesting, so the creatures are almost manifestations of moments in your life?**
They definitely feed the process, but I would say I draw more on the feeling of my experience rather than the direct experience.

**Right, I understand. So what’s your process for bringing a piece to life? Do you have a diary or sketchbook where these creatures start or do you start directly on the final piece?**
Sometimes I’ll have a sketch I want to take forward, or at least elements of it. Usually I’ll just get stuck into the work, and wrestle with the surface until I’m happy with it.

**Yeah the surface textures you get are wonderful. Pieces like ‘Star eater’ and ‘Smiling god’ are great examples of this. **
**What external influences do you draw from? Are there particular myth/folklore sources that you like or artists which you find inspiration from?**
Thank you, I draw a lot upon rock/cave art: How they created myths and recorded their lives for their descendants to learn from, has left an impression on me as to how I should conduct my own practice.

There are a number of things a draw upon, included Greek mythology, Christian writings and occult subjects. I have a book on the classification of demons, their powers and their origins. Things like this really interest me. 

 I also like to read manga and manwha. The stories that draw on existing myths or borrow parts of mythology are the ones I’m usually drawn to. The world building that is in some of them is astounding and the art is incredible. 

I think things that allow the mind to wander and become blissfully lost will always draw me in. I love escaping into different worlds.
