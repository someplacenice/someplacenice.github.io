      <div class="interview-column">
        <p><strong>When did you start making art?</strong></p>
        <p>
          I've been making art for most of my life I started making little comics featuring computer game characters like Sonic the Hedgehog aged around six or seven.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Tell us a little bit about how you came to make art?</strong></p>
        <p>
          One of the first things I remember clearly was flicking through an old Encyclopedia from the 1960's that had belonged to my mother. I remember one of the images in the book was Nicholas Poussin's painting A Dance to the Music of Time.That image has always stayed with me.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What is your approach or process towards painting?</strong></p>
        <p>
          My current process towards painting is all about creating texture. I staple an
unstretched canvas to the wall then I quickly sketch the basic design onto the canvas
using whatever I have to hand it could be a marker pen or paint. Then I begin adding
paint and collaging on strips of canvas or whatever I can find around the studio, to
build up the surface. Usually there are several failed paintings underneath a finished
one.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Where do you find inspiration for your work?</strong></p>
        <p>
          I lived in China for almost five years. It was during this time abroad that I began to
          find inspiration in British culture. At first it was mostly cartoons I remembered as a kid
          then religious imagery became the main focus especially pre renaissance art where
          the figures are both comical and sincere at the same time.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What do you aim to communicate with your work?</strong></p>
        <p>
          I'm never quite sure exactly what I want to communicate. I tend to leave it open for
          the viewer to interpret. Having said that though I definitely have an appreciation for
          medieval art and religious art in general which I hope the viewer notices. I’m not
          trying to be satirical.

      <div class="interview-column">
        <p><strong>Who are your favourite artists?</strong></p>
        <p>
          There's so many and it always changes but to name a few: Francis Bacon, Leon
          Kossoff, William Hawkins, Fra Angelico, Danny Fox. The nameless medieval church
          wall painters and manuscript illuminators.
          </p>
        <p><strong>Take us through a standard day in the studio for you.</strong></p>
        <p>
          On a normal day I get into the studio, after finishing my day job as an Art teacher at a
          school in Essex, about 6pm. I’ll usually pick up something for dinner on the way
          home. I’ll typically put a podcast on or some music. Then I’ll begin slapping paint on
          the canvas until I feel hungry again and have a snack. I usually down tools around
          11pm.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Is there anything you'd like to explore in the future? New mediums or new themes?</strong></p>
        <p>
          I think I'd love to get back to some of the cartoon imagery that was what got me
          started on my current journey. For now though I’m enjoying my medieval inspired
          work. There’s so many strange and interesting images to be found in medieval
          manuscripts and church wall paints. The inspiration is endless.
